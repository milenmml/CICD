-container runtime â€“ containerd, which will be prepaired for later as container runtime for our k8s cluster
-crictl - command-line interface for container runtime

k8sMaster.sh:
-Will install provision k8s master node trought kubeadm tool


k8sWorker.sh:
-Will prepair nodes which will be worker nodes in our cluster and after this you should get token from master node to join worker nodes to the cluster.

jen.sh:
- Should be executed on k8s master node it will provision jenkins container, later we will use jenkins for CI process

argo.sh:
-Should be executed on k8s master node and it will provision ArgoCD application in our k8s cluster. Application will be used as GitOps to deploying applications from github to our k8s cluster.
